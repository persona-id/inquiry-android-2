## [v2.6.0]

### Changed
**UI UPDATES: GOVERNMENT ID CAMERA CAPTURE SCREEN**
We’ve changed the animation that plays on the screen where the user is asked to take a photo of
their government ID. The previous animation featured a line sweeping back and forth, horizontally.
This animation has been replaced with a more subtle sweeping animation around the border of the
camera preview frame. The new animation is designed to be performant and distraction-free. It is
rendered with custom code for better performance.

We've also added a button to the government id capture screen that displays capture tips when 
tapped. This change was made to improve the quality of photos captured by the user.

If you have any questions about these changes, please reach out to your CSM.

**UI UPDATES: SELFIE CAMERA CAPTURE SCREEN**

We’ve made updates to the selfie verification flow to help reduce blurry and repeat pose captures.
You’ll notice the following changes to the selfie verification flow:

- New selfie animation includes an arrow that points users in the direction they should look for
  left and right pose capture.

- Auto-capture is delayed for left and right pose until each animation plays. In addition, user will
  be able to clearly preview selfie during capture (blur overlay removed).

If you have any questions about these changes, please reach out to your CSM.
